# Beer Pad

Beer Pad is an iOS app created using Appcelerator/Titanium. It allows users to create a personal notebook of beers that they've tried, and it uses many of Appcelerators APIs to accesses core mobile functionality such as the SQL Lite data base, networking, camera, photo gallary, location services and built-in maps.

It utilises the Alloy MVC framework to organise the code into models, views and controllers. Each of the main screens has it's own and controller, and the beer list is managed as a model. Common JS is used to create modules that contain general utility functions and more complex or reusable UI code in order to make the controllers more concise.
